# deeplearningai-machine-learning-specialization
Code written for practice labs in the Machine Learning Specialization taught by Andrew Ng on DeepLearning.AI.

There are three courses covered in this specialization:

- Supervised machine learning: regression and classification

- Advanced learning algorithms (neural networks, model diagnostics, and decision trees)

- Unsupervised learning and recommender systems (clustering, anomaly detection, deep reinforcement learning model)

**Note**: This repository also contains some codes written by the course staffs as a template.
